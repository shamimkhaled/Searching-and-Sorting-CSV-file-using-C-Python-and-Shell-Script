Description:
The aim of this assignment was to search and sort through a large csv file containing around 166756 entries (rows) using three different programming languages. We implemented the code using C++, Python, Shell script. The assignment was to sort by specific column through the csv file and search through the csv file for specific time reference, account, country code, code, product type and status.

Programming Languages used:

Python:
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. It is a programming language that is simple, easy-to-learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance and integrate our system more effectively. 

Shell Script:
Shell Scripting is an open-source computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell. Shell is a just programming interface for interacting between a user and an operating system service. Shell is a program that provides interface to the users and accepts human-readable commands into the system and executes those commands which can run automatically and give the program’s output in a shell script.

C++:
C++ is a general-purpose, case sensitive programming language. It has procedural, generic programming features, and object-oriented, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

Let’s talk about the comparison criteria between those three programming languages. Such as,
Readability:
Python is known for its consistency and readability and is more efficient. Python is a simple and very good to use programming language it is easy to understand. It has incredibly compact language syntax, in that functions and classes tend to take very little vertical space. That makes it much easier to understand functions at a glance. Python is the most readable than Shell script and C++ programming language. On the other hand, Shell script is quite ambiguous. 
In terms of readability, the problem that was given in the assignment, C++ is likely to be more readable than shell script but not more than python. C++ is not an overall simple language which complicates its readability. In terms of syntax design, C++ ‘s names are case sensitive and does not specify a length limit on names which increases readability. For example, a RealVariableName is much easier to read than AREALVARIABLENAME. The use of upper-case letters also helps identifiers to stand out in the code and improves its readability. 

Writability:
Python is an easy writing language it has the ability for the function to return more than one parameter and we all know how useful that is. Its automatic memory management allows you to write code without the worry of overflow or out or stack errors. It also has a very clear flow from top to bottom that allows easy writing of the code. It is easier to write programs in C++ than to read programs written in C++. The reasons are C++ has rich data types and supports abstraction which improves its writability abstraction which improves its writability. C++ also has efficient expressivity provided by a rich set of operators which allow the programmers to solve the different/difficult problems with a very small program making it very writable.
In terms of writability, Shell script is ahead of the other two hands down. It takes very minor amount of code less than python, to sort and conduct search in a file with shell script. Python is also required more less code to write than C++.

Reliability:
Python is obviously a highly reliable language. It, being an easily read language, is better able to be debugged should an error creep into the programming. Python can be run in an interpreter as well as an executable and its use of standardized libraries allow more people to use the same set of code to ensure that the program runs correctly. This also makes the language easier to learn.
C++ is a dominant object-oriented programming language and it is reliable if a programmer uses it carefully. C++ supports abstraction and information hiding which improves its reliability. C++ offers a comprehensive exception handling system which uses the try and catch blocks and it can catch runtime errors, fix the problem and continue the program. The exception handling improves its reliability.

Performance:
We have found that performance-wise, Python is likely to take less time for searching and sorting than C++. On the other hand, Shell script can directly execute the program in the command-line interface. So, the Shell script is very fast. Length: Shell script: 73 lines (including spaces) Python: 90 lines (including spaces) C++: 227 lines (including spaces) Shell script has the least lines of code in terms of execution followed by python and C++ has the greatest number of lines. Run Time: C++: 121.617 seconds (for sorting) and 40.107 seconds (for searching) Python: 26.78 seconds (for searching) and 29.12 second (for sorting) Shell script: 17.10 seconds (for searching). Eventually, Shell script wins the race in terms of execution time. Python takes second place followed by C++.
